## Movie_recommender_system using tmdb datasets
A content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity

#Usage
Select a movie from the dropdown menu.
Click the "Recommend" button to get a list of recommended movies.
View the recommended movies and their posters in a grid layout.
Model Details
The recommender system is based on a content-based filtering model, where movies are recommended based on their tags, genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

The model uses a CountVectorizer for feature extraction and computes cosine similarity for movie recommendations.
